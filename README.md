# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-for-credit-card-users

Customer segmentation is a major task in the credit card industry since it helps organisations better understand the preferences and behaviours of their customers. Due to the lack of labelled data, unsupervised learning approaches have been extensively used in consumer segmentation. Using a real-world credit card dataset, this paper gives a study of unsupervised learning algorithms for credit card client segmentation. We assess a number of unsupervised clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN, K-means, hierarchical and BIRCH . According to the experimental findings, K-means performs better than other algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. According to our research, unsupervised learning holds promise for credit card client segmentation, particularly in cases when labelled data is hard to come by.
